X is an everything app

Tech users are spoilt with too many choices of apps that perform the same tasks, and so the attention needed to achieve a specific solution is not laser focused enough.

The idea is to bring the greatest(everyone) minds on one single app with standardized and well proven best practices.

**X** will start from Metal to user (OS to application)

This is more like Docker for UI and Logic

Insted of we having too many varieties of Apps, we reverse the process by having one and putting all the effort and expertise into that.

**Architecture**

OS - Micro Kernel based (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel)

Drivers - universal standard based drivers

Application Layer - all applications should have same binary standards so as to run everywhere

App Logic - this is programming language agnostic as the UI should work with any programming language similar to how XUL works.
