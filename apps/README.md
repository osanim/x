# We believe all softwares should be Free and Open source

### Proprietary softwares should provide niche IP via sdk/api services, users who need these services can purchase a license for the extra niche features. This is important to preserve the company's IP. And users who have no need for the niche features (community powered) just use the default which is good enough.

This is very disruptive and we are looking for ways to leave room for every party to still play.
